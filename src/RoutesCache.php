/**
 * Cached Routes Implementation
 *
 * High-performance route collection that operates with pre-compiled route data
 * for optimal performance in production environments. This class extends the base
 * Routes functionality while providing fast lookup through cached route data.
 *
 * The cache stores route information in a structured format with pre-compiled
 * regular expressions and metadata, eliminating the need for runtime compilation
 * during route matching operations.
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - Extends Routes class for hybrid functionality (cache + runtime routes)
 * - Uses PathExtractor trait for consistent URI path normalization
 * - Implements efficient two-tier lookup: runtime routes â†’ cached routes
 * - Supports both static (O(1)) and dynamic (regex) route matching
 *
 * Cache Structure:
 * The cache is organized into two main sections for performance optimization:
 * - static: Routes without parameters for direct string comparison
 * - dynamic: Routes with parameters requiring regex pattern matching
 *
 * Each route entry contains complete route metadata:
 * - name: Unique route identifier for lookups and URL generation
 * - path: Original route pattern with parameter placeholders
 * - methods: Array of allowed HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.)
 * - regex: Pre-compiled regular expression for URL matching
 * - handler: Route handler (controller class, callable, etc.)
 * - middleware: Middleware stack to execute before the handler
 * - group: Optional route group identifier for organization
 * - parameters: Parameter names extracted from the route pattern
 * - defaults: Default values for optional or missing parameters
 *
 * Performance Benefits:
 * - No runtime route compilation for cached routes
 * - Pre-computed regex patterns eliminate compilation overhead
 * - Optimized lookup strategies for different route types
 * - Memory-efficient iteration with lazy RouteRecord instantiation
 * - Fast path extraction with consistent normalization
 *
 * @template T of array{
 *  name: string,
 *  path: string,
 *  methods: array<string>,
 *  regex: string,
 *  handler: mixed,
 *  middleware: array<mixed>,
 *  group: ?string,
 *  parameters: array<string>,
 *  defaults: ?array<string, mixed>,
